<h2>Site Intent</h2>
<p>The object for the site redesign of Fat Wreck Chords is to organize the content of the site in a 
way that is easy to navigate but it still aesthetically pleasing to the targeted audience. 
While the overall design of the site is very fitting for the content, it is lacking in organization
 and does not flow well making it difficult to navigate. On top of this, the ratio of content to space
 used is very offset. There is way too much going on within the small area being used which yet again, 
 makes it difficult to read the content. Blank space is not being put to good use. The code is also very 
 unoganized and sloppy which could slow the site down and make it difficult to load on slower internet 
 connections. </p>

<h2>Demographics and Target Audience</h2>

<p> After looking over the demographic page for the target audience, I have discovered the following:</br>
</br>
The age range for the target audience for fatwreck.com was very strongly around the 18-34 range with little
to no college experience. They were mostly male and less likely to have children. The majority of the viewing
was done from home rather than work.

<h2>Competitors</h2>
<p>After viewing several websites that cater to similar target audiences, I've discovered that
the best approach to this redesign should be a sleek but still slightly grunge style. The layouts of
the majority of competitors are very simplistic in colour and flow easily from left to right. A few have
a hint of texture work to make the content stand out and portray the type of music they are selling.</p>

<h3>epitaph.com</h3>
<p><em>Alexa Global Traffic Rating: 400,639</em></p>

<p>Ephitaph.com has a great mix of clean, sleek, and grunge throughout the site. It uses grungy texture 
work bordering rounded corners with a mix of flash to make it pop. The navigation while small, is still 
easy to find and to the point. Overall, I feel it hosts a professional look but still appeals to its 
target audience.</p>

<h3>surus.co.uk</h3>
<p><em>Alexa Global Traffic Rating:  614,308</em></p>

<p>Surus has a look that is very simplistic but still professional. It uses sharp corners and a greyscale
 colour scheme with a hint of colour to make certain content pop. While there is a lot of white space, 
 it is not overwhelming and is almost gride-like. Yet again, a very simple navigation that is easy to 
 find and to the point. Everything you need is easily accessable and right where you need it to be.</p>

<h3>chemical-records.co.uk</h3>
<p><em>Alexa Global Traffic Rating: 92,807</em></p>

<p>Yet again, another site that uses a very simple gride-like layout that still looks professional and 
flows well for the viewer. It has multiple nagivations to help find the music you're looking for. The top
 navigation is short, simple and to the point where as the side navigation is a little more refined to 
 help you find specific music genres and sub-genres.
