		<h2>Site Intent</h2> 
			<p>The objective for this site redesign of Get Gaming Orlando is to
			organize the website so that the content is more focused on the actual overall purpose of
			the site. The goal for this redesign is not only to make the content more focused but also
			to correct issues such as a buggy navigation that either jumps around or does not load at
			all; colors and fonts that are difficult to see and thus making it difficult to read the
			content; and better choices in overall layout such as a more distinct navigation/header,
			footer, etc.</p>
	</div>

		<h2>Website Keywords</h2>
			<p>wii repair, ps3 repair, playstation 3 repair orlando, orlando,
			playstation 3 repair, iphone repair, xbox repair, playstation repair, winter garden fl,
			game console repair, console repair, gaming</p>

		<h2>Demographics and Target Audience</h2>

			<p>While Alexa's page for Get Gaming Orlando was lacking in information, after viewing
			similar competitors pages who had more information available, this is what I discovered:

			The average age of the overall audience was either 18-24 or 35-44. The majority were males
			with either no college or some college education. They were either browsing from school or
			work. About 85 percent of the viewers were from the United States.</p>

		<h2>Competitors</h2>
		
		<p>After going through the competitor's websites, I believe it is safe to assume that content
				should be simple and to the point. Everything should be easy on the viewer's eyes and have
				information redly available to the viewer. Colors and fonts do not need to be flashy but
				images are useful to explain the purpose of the site.</p>

			<h3>ubreakifix.com</h3>
			<p><em>Alexa Global Traffic Rating:  218,975</em></p>

				<p>The overall design of ubreakifix.com's website is very clean and to the point. The color
				choice is much easier on the eyes, information is easily accessible, and is extremely
				organized. it's a very simple design with the main focus being on the purpose of the site
				but still looks extremely well done and professional.</p>

			<h3>Geeksquad.com</h3>
			<p><em>Alexa Global Traffic Rating: 37,811</em></p>

				<p>The same basic design flow is used with geeksquad.com's website as ubreakifix.com's
				website. Simple colors, simple menus large banners being the main focal point with easy to
				find, organized information all throughout the site.</p>

			<h3>uptechusa.com</h3>
			 <p><em>Alexa Global Traffic Rating: 18,490,634</em></p>

				<p>Unlike the other sites, uptech's site seems to be horribly outdated and lacking in eye
				catching design. The colors are almost painful to the viewer's eyes but the overall site
				is fairly organized, holding all the basic information needed to be useful. I assume the
				main reason why they have so much traffic is due to the fact that they have been up since
				1997.
